										<h2>World Class Pedigrees</h2>
										<p>We've been making world class pedigrees for over 40 years. It's our passion.</p>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>40 years ago, we found a need. Pedigrees were inconsistent and poorly written, maintained and produced. We've filled that gap and continue to fill that gap for the major auctions that are held around the world every year. Our main goal is to create a product that we are proud to have our name on. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>When we wrap up a sale and catch our breath, we always nitpick and critique our work to see if there was something that we could have done better. We do that with everything from our work flow to our final product. If there is one thing we could have done better, we make sure it will be fixed next time.</p>

							<h2>Pocket Pedigrees</h2>
							<p>A pocket size pedigree for every one of your horses.</p>
						</header>
						<p>We make pocket sized pedigrees that are perfect for keeping track of your horses. We'll print and bind them so all you have to do is give us a list of the horses you want in your new book.</p>
						<p>These are the perfect size to mail out to your clients if you are a bloodstock agent. They are also a good size to keep with you to hand out to potential buyers.</p>
						<p>These are great because they are quick and affordable to make. We can make anywhere from 5 to 5,000 depending on your needs.</p>

						<p>We make pedigree books that are both paper and electronic. We can customize them to be a single page or more. We can also include any media you want to provide. (Electronic version only).</p>
						<p>If the breeders, trainers, managers, vets and anyone else involved with that horse has the right information they can do miracles. Not only can they do what will bring in the most money, but also what is best for the horse. It is a win-win situation.</p>
