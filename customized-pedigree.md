##Problem
You go online to see your horses pedigree before the sale. You're reading through everything to make sure it all looks good. Then you see something you don't like.

You call the auction company, you talk to the pedigree writers and they can't change it because we have rules to follow! It's frustrating!

You have an amazing horse and it has a great pedigree, but you can only fit so much on 64 lines while following the international standards. That's why we started making these customized pedigrees for consigners and horse owners.

##Aggetator
You're trying to promote your horse at the sale, but you feel like you aren't moving the needle any. You're working the room and you feel like your horse just isn't the eyes on it you'd like.

Then when you're horse is in the ring, it gets an RNA. If there was just another $1,000 you'd be happy, but it fell short.

##Solution
Imagine having a pedigree that is chalked full of information that has a nice pop of color so you can get the eyes on your horse that you need. The best part about it is that you don't have to follow the ICC rules so if there is a different way you'd like to portray your information, you can do that here!

##CTA
