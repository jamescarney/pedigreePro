##Our History
More than 40 years ago, Sissy and Bill Woolums saw a need and she filled it and we've been in business ever since. What was once a business that was ran on a coffee table in the living room, has grown for the past 40 years into a mature company that is smart, innovative and meticulous about each pedigree book we write.

We've expanded our product and service line along the way too. We have been able to adapt our products so they are suitable for every person involved in the horses life. The farm owner, the managers, the breeders, the trainers and everyone in between.

##Our Philosophy
We've been making pedigrees for over 40 years. We are well versed in what it takes to write great pedigrees. We have been making pedigrees for large 1,000 plus horse sales to just a single pedigree for an owner. When it comes to writing pedigrees, we've done it all. With that said, we aren't for everyone. If you are looking to get your pedigrees made by a massive company that uses a computer program to quickly and cheaply make generic pedigrees, then we aren't your company. If you are more interested in the bottom line than a quality product that is meticulously looked over to ensure that it is the best it can be, then we aren't your company. 

If you are interested in buying a pedigree that is hand designed for your horse or horses, then we are your company. If you are interested in a pedigree that shows off your horse and the pedigree line in the best possible light, then we are your company. If you don't mind waiting an extra hour or two to make sure your pedigree is perfect, then we are your company.

##Our Work
If you are interested in what type of work we do, I'll give you a hint - It's great work. We have been in business for over 40 years, and we don't get to stay in business unless we bust our butt making sure we produce the nicest looking and best written pedigree out there. So when we say our work is great work, we aren't being arrogant, we are being honest and confident. We've built and maintained a business based off the quality of our work and we are proud of that. 

If you want to see some samples of what we've done in the past, go check out the home page and you'll see a list of the different products we've made in the past. We've generally make sales catalogs, books for in house uses for farms, bloodstock agents and consigners. If you are interested in that, then email [James](mailto:james@pedigreepro.net).
