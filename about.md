#Our History

More than 40 years ago, Sissy and Bill Woolums saw a need and she filled it. We've been in business ever since. We've been making pedigrees and doing pedigree research for almost half a century. It's been a blast, we've helped alot of people along the way too.

We've expanded our products so we work more with farms as well. We do a lot of work with private farms who want nice looking pedigrees for their own use.
