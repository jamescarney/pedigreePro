I started reading pedigrees when I was a little kid. I remember going to the sales with my grandmother and she would get me a catalog and I would browse through the book and I would try and guess how much a horse would go for. When I was younger, I had no idea what made a horse good or bad, I could read the information and tell you what it meant but couldn't tell you what was good or bad. I feel like I've gained a little more knowledge over the years and have learned what makes a horse valuable based off there pedigree.

That is what this article is going to be about. We're going to go over the big picture of a pedigree, then dive into each section of the pedigree and talk about what makes each section important.

##The Basics

Lets start off with the basics. A pedigree is broken up into a couple main sections. At the top, you have what's called the 3 cross. It shows the sires and dams to the 3rd generation. So the great-granddam and sire. 

Going down the page you have the sire blurb. The sire blurb is a quick several line blurb about how successful the sire was as a race horse (How many races has the horse won), and how successful it's offspring has been. 

Next on the page is the female family. This is going to be the majority of a pedigree page. It will have as little as just the first dam to as much as the first thru fourth dam. Here we are trying to see if the horse not-only has fast relatives, but also has a strong ability to <em>produce</em> other successful horses. For instance, you wouldn't want to buy a horse that is a sister to several million dollar horses, but each sibling has produced several horses that were unplaced in several starts. You want a horse that has a family with a lot of success on the track, but you also want to see that those horses have produced other horses that have <em>ALSO</em> had success on the track.

Finally, we have the subject horses information. We'll have a Race Record of the horse so we can see how the horse has done on the track. A Produce Record shows if it has any children of its own (only if the horse is a mare :D ). You will be able to see what type of caliber offspring the horse has been producing because of the short race records of the offspring that have raced. If the horse is pregnant, you'll see a sire blurb of the covering sire, which will have the same type of information that is in the sire blurb up at the top of the page.



##Diving Deeper
If you just want a general overview, stop here. The further you go now, the more in dept it will get. If you want to get into the nitty gritty, then keep reading. We'll start off in the same order as above, and work our way down the page so there is a little logic to it.

###The 3 cross
I don't really need to go into detail here. The 3 cross is just a way to see the family tree as an overview. Here the main thing I'm looking at is name recognition. Are there any names that pop out as having great records either as a race horse.

###The Sire Blurb
The sire blurb tells you all about the sire of the subject horse. There is a lot of really important information to look at while you're reading this. There are a few key words to look for while reading this that will show a lot of potential in this small little blurb. 

The first thing you need to look at is how old the sire is. The age isn't a deterent for you, but it will give you a reference point. Meaning, if a horse that has 6 crops has around $10 million and then there is a horse with 16 crops with the same amount of money, it changes the conversation a little! So that's what you're looking for. Obviously there are some pros and cons with having an old or young sire, but that is beyond the scope of this article.

You'll also see some of the accolades of the racing career of the sire. These are very abbreviated compared to what's on the rest of the pedigree, but they can be indicative of how successful the horse will be.

You'll then see the information about the sire's offspring. How much money all of his offspring has won total and how many are graded stakes winners then some successful ones if there is room. That will give you an idea of what horses have done well that the sire has sired. That is important, because you can see how that sire does with different dams. That is called nicking, and that is beyong what this article is able to discuss. If you want more information on nicking, I'd check out [this site](http://www.truenicks.com/).

###The Female Family
The meat and potatos of the pedigree are in this part of the pedigree. Here, we have the bottom half of the 3 cross. It's broken up by primary dam (1st dam, 2nd dam, etc.). Starting off with 1st dam, we have the sire of the first dam. The first dam's sire is the broodmare sire. 

After the sire, we go into the race record of the primary dam. In the parenthesis there is the track abbreviation and the money earned from the purse. There are a lot of random track abbreviations, so here is a list of them [here](http://www1.drf.com/misc/pursevalueindex.pdf). The reason why you want to know the track and money is because some tracks are more prestigous than others.
