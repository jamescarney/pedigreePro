##The Greatest Horses Never Bred

When you start planning for next year, it can be really frustrating when your team lacks all the information they need to make informed decisions. You are working on designing your next year's schedules and every member of your team has something different and is thinking something totally different. That is very frustrating. 


##Aggregation

The worst part? When you have a pedigree that needs to get updated, not everything gets updated so some people are walking around with complete and accurate pedigrees while other people are walking around with pedigrees that are not updated, thus people aren't able to make the best decisions for your horse and for your farm.

##The Pedigree Portfolio Solution

When we make your pedigree portfolio, we make pedigrees for the entire team. That means your entire team! You get paper books along with your choice of PDF versions or HTML versions. Both are great for putting online so your whole staff can more accurately communicate with each other. The best part? They are automatically updated every year or quarter, depending on what you want!

When everyone has the same information, you can make better choices. Not only for you, but also for the horse. If the breeder, trainer, manager and anyone else who touches that horse, you can feel secure knowing that you are making the best possible decision you can make.
